 
I like to have a example where the  the solution can be solved by composite design pattern .

Basic feature of composite design pattern is


Step1 :-A component which provide interface  to the user. The component can be categorized

into various types .

Step2 : A composite is provide a group .

Step4 : A leaf which is a object in interest of user


So a composite dills with a hierarchical structure , Composite provide a root and the leafs are its elements .

And component is the interface to user .

Example :-


Varun is a biology student , requested me to provide some application throw which he can get  information

about mammal, animals and birds and its features .


how can i solve this using  a composit design pattern ?

Human ,  monkey are group of mammal

tiger , dog are group of animal

pigeon , duck are group of birds.


In this case we have three composites .

1- mammal

2. Animals

3. Birds


human , monkey are leafs of mammal

tiger , dog are leafs of animals

pigeon and duck are leafs of Birds


The information which user wants to know about

these objects are call the component.


component can be named as BiologicalInfo (Provide information about various object)
