 What is a adaptor pattorn?
 
 Ans:- A adoptor pattorn is something adopting a not related already existing interface ,
       just because client needs it .
       
       Example : In my sytem already "Shape" class is availabe with interface create and display ,
       the responsibility for the shape interface to create a Geometrical figure such as "Trangle" , "Polygon"
       or "rectangle" Etc .
       
       My system is running well , But suddenly my client request me to provide Same "Shape interface" to draw a 
       Text , because clint dose not add any implimetation for a text . that means clint code do not want to chnage 
       there inmplimetation to supoort "Text" .
       
 How It is benifits ?

 We can have Solid design pattern by achiveing the Adaptor pattern . 
 By Adopting existing interface we can able extend our support 
 for new requairments insted modifying the existiong clinent code if existing service code .

 Provide a Example of Adaptor design pattern ?
 
 I provide a lib To draw diffrent shape like rectangle , trangle , circle which represent a geomectry shape.
 and wants adapt a new concreate class which will help me to use same interface to draw a text shape .
